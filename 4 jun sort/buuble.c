//time complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case
//space complexity: O(1) as it sorts in place   
//working: The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the
//compare if adjacent elements is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
